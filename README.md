# The Garage

[![CI](https://github.com/mihailgaberov/the-garage/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mihailgaberov/the-garage/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A simple app implementing a _parking garage_. 

## Functionality:
 - List all vehicles in the garage. 
 - The list supports paging.
 - The list can be filtered by level and/or by type. Multiple filters can be selected, also from
different categories. Filters within one category are OR connected; filters in different
categories are AND-connected.
 - The list can be filtered by typing the license number into the search field.

## Tech stack
- React / Typescript
- SASS / styled-components
- react-testing-library
